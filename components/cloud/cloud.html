                <p>Cloud Computing provides the speed, scalability, and flexibility that enables businesses to develop,

                    Cloud Computing allows you to rent instead of buy your IT. Rather than investing heavily in
                    databases, software, and hardware, companies opt to access their compute power via the internet, or
                    the cloud, and pay for it as they use it.
                    These cloud services now include, but are not limited to, servers, storage, databases, networking,
                    software, analytics, and business intelligence.

                <h3 class="p-heading"> Types Of Cloud Computing </h3>
                There are three types of clouds − Public, Private, and Hybrid cloud.
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">1. Public Cloud:</span>
                         In public cloud, the third-party service providers make resources and services available to their customers via Internet. Customer’s data and related security is with the service providers’ owned infrastructure. </li>
                    <li>2. Private Cloud:
                        A private cloud also provides almost similar features as public cloud, but the data and services are managed by the organization or by the third party only for the customer’s organization. In this type of cloud, major control is over the infrastructure so security related issues are minimized.</li>
                    <li>3. Hybrid Cloud: 
                        A hybrid cloud is the combination of both private and public cloud. The decision to run on private or public cloud usually depends on various parameters like sensitivity of data and applications, industry certifications and required standards, regulations, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="writeup">
                <h3 class="p-heading">Services of Cloud Computing</h3>
                Cloud computing is not a single piece of technology like a microchip or a cellphone. Rather, it's a system primarily comprised of three services: software-as-a-service (SaaS), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), and platform-as-a-service (PaaS).
                <ul>
                   <li>1. Software-as-a-service (SaaS):  involves the licensure of a software application to customers. Licenses are typically provided through a pay-as-you-go model or on-demand. This type of system can be found in Microsoft Office's 365.</li>
                   <li>2. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS):  involves a method for delivering everything from operating systems to servers and storage through IP-based connectivity as part of an on-demand service. Clients can avoid the need to purchase software or servers, and instead procure these resources in an outsourced, on-demand service. Popular examples of the IaaS system include IBM Cloud and Microsoft Azure.</li>
                   <li>3. Platform-as-a-service (PaaS): is considered the most complex of the three layers of cloud-based computing. PaaS shares some similarities with SaaS, the primary difference being that instead of delivering software online, it is actually a platform for creating software that is delivered via the Internet. This model includes platforms like Salesforce.com and Heroku.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="writeup">
                <h3 class="p-heading">Working Of Cloud Computing</h3>
                <p>
                    Cloud computing is an application-based software infrastructure that stores data on remote serves, which can be accessed through the internet. To understand how cloud computing works, it can be divided into front-end and backend.
                    <ul>
                    <li>1. The front end enables a user to access data stored in the cloud using an internet browser or a cloud computing software. However, the primary component of cloud computing – responsible for securely storing data and information – is the backend. It comprises servers, computers, databases, and central servers.</li>

                    <li>2.The central server facilitates operations by following a set of rules known as protocols. It uses a software, middleware, to ensure seamless connectivity between devices/computers linked via cloud computing. Cloud computing service providers usually maintain multiple copies of the data to mitigate instances of security threats, data loss, data breach, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 class="p-heading" > Cloud Computing vs. Traditional Web Hosting</h3>
                Given the many different services and capabilities of the public cloud, there has been some confusion between cloud computing and major uses, such as web hosting. While the public cloud is often used for web hosting, the two are quite different. A cloud service has three distinct characteristics that differentiate it from traditional web hosting:
                <ul>
                <li>1. Users can access large amounts of computing power on demand. It is typically sold by the minute or the hour.</li>
                <li>2. It is elastic -- users can have as much or as little of a service as they want at any given time.</li>
                <li>3. The service is fully managed by the provider -- the consumer needs nothing but a personal computer and internet access. Significant innovations in virtualization and distributed computing, as well as improved access to high-speed internet, have accelerated interest in cloud computing.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3 class="p-heading"> Cloud Computing On AWS </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Pricing:
                        AWS offers a pay-as-you-go approach for pricing.
                        Pricing for each service is unique.</li>
                    <li>2. Products:
                        AWS has over 175 fully featured services for a wide range of technologies, industries, and use cases.</li>
                    <li>3. Global infrastructure:
                        AWS has the most extensive, reliable, and secure global cloud infrastructure.</li>
